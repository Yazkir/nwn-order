## Setup help
This software is still early in development so the setup readme is a WIP. 

- Copy the /order folder to your current root folder.
- Compare the env files out of /config to your current docker setup
- Compare docker-compose.yml and add the order service to your current docker-compose file

The two best places to get started using this software:
